# Netflix Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Netflix data to uncover insights using Python. The notebook demonstrates data preparation, exploratory analysis, and key visualizations for understanding trends in Netflix content.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`Netflix Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the code for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **`datasets/`**: The folder containing the Netflix dataset 
- **`outputs/`**: Plots, charts, and other visual outputs generated from the analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - Content distribution over years.
  - Genre analysis and trends.
  - Insights into regional preferences.
- Visualizations: Interactive and static plots using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## 🔧 Tools Used
